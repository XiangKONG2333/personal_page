The objectives of this seesions are:
1. Highlight material constitutive behavior importance for the industry in general;
2. Learn how to conduct a mechanical tension test, understand measurement and error (in particular regarding strain measures);
3. Highlight the interest of varying test parameters (loading speed, temperature);
4. Review mechanics of materials fundamentals (Young's modulus, elastic limit, work hardening and plasticity...);
5. Understand what is a material constitutive behavior and how to identify it from experimental testing.
