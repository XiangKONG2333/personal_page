The anisotropic material behaviour of an anisotropic recrystallised AA2198 Al-Cu-Li alloy in T3 and T8 conditions was assessed by proportional loading of uniaxial-tension specimens in rolling (L), transverse (T) and diagonal (D) orientations. The width and longitudinal strains were measured to quantify plastic anisotropy.
